### Interactive Country Data Table Component

This project involves building an interactive country data table component that fetches country information from a GraphQL API and displays it. the app also has various features like filtering, pagination, and search functionality.

### Features and Requirements:

1. **Data Display**:

   - Fetch and display country data from the provided GraphQL endpoint.
   - Columns to display:
     - **Country Name**
     - **Country Code**
     - **Continent**
     - **Currency**
   - Show the total number of entries in the dataset.

2. **Pagination**:

   - Implement table pagination with:
     - Options for entries per page (10, 20, 50, 100).
     - Display the current page number and total pages.
     - Add previous/next navigation buttons.
     - Update the URL to reflect the current page state for better user experience.

3. **Filtering & Search**:

   - Add a **continent filter** dropdown to filter countries by continent.
   - Add a **currency filter** dropdown to filter countries by currency.
   - Create a **search** feature:
     - Exact match search for **country code**.
     - Fuzzy search for **country name** (partial matching).
   - Filters should be combinable, meaning users can apply multiple filters at the same time.
   - Update the results in real-time as filters change.

4. **Technical Requirements**:

   - **TypeScript** for all components and utilities to ensure type safety and easy maintainability.
   - **Apollo GraphQL Client** to fetch data from the GraphQL API (`https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql`).
   - **Tailwind CSS** for styling, ensuring a responsive layout.
   - **Recoil (optional)** for managing global state across the components.
   - Implement proper **error handling** for API calls, including loading and error states.
   - Ensure the design is **responsive** across all screen sizes.

5. **Additional Notes**:
   - **Debounce** should be implemented for the search input to reduce the number of requests while typing.
   - Use a **loading state** to show when data is being fetched asynchronously.
   - **Pagination state** should update the URL so the page can be bookmarked or shared with the same data view.

### Code Explanation:

1. **Apollo GraphQL Client**:  
   I used Apollo Client to fetch data from the GraphQL API. Weâ€™ll define a query to fetch the required fields (country name, code, continent, and currency) and use `useQuery` to fetch the data inside our component.

2. **Table Component**:  
   The table displays country data dynamically.

3. **Pagination**:  
   Pagination controls added at the bottom of the table, handle's page state and the number of items per page using React state, and update the displayed data accordingly.

4. **Filtering & Search**:  
   Filters implemented as dropdowns, with handlers to update the table data based on the selected filters. The search bar will filter by country code (exact match) or country name.
